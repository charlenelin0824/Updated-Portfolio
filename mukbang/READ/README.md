## Eating Show: From Quantity to Quality

In this story, I explored the key to the success formula of eating show videos (mukbang) and traced back to the history of eating shows before YouTube and live streaming came into place.
A few types of videos are associated with more views: 
- overeating
- eating fast within a certain amount of time
- eating irritating/spicy food

A few subtle things most mukbang creators do:
- placing the food plate higher up to the camera instead of on a normal dining table
- eating a large bite (up to a portion with a 6.5 cm diameter)
- never cut noodles with teeth - eat as much as possible by slurping
- eating without looking at the camera to let the audience focus on the food
- eating while facing slightly to the side (20-30 degrees) presents the food the best and avoids showing inner mouth to the audience
