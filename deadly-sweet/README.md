# Sugar in American Diet Compared Internationally
## Main findings: ##
- A typical bubble tea with full sugar in the US is 25% sweeter than that in Taiwan
- OREOs in the US are 8-28% sweeter than those in Taiwan, depending on their flavor
- American signature cookies contain the highest amount of sugar per cookie compared with other countries
- Obesity rate in America has been the highest among developed countries, and obesity-related deaths per 100K people have tripled in the past two decades
## Data Collection and Analysis##
- **Added sugar in OREO:** I searched for the nutrition fact labels in different languages (Korean, Japanese, English, Mandarin) and decided to focus on the US-Taiwan comparison.
- **Added sugar in signature cookies:** I gathered nine signature cookies from countries that most people are familiar with and looked up their nutritional facts/recipes.
- **Real-life cases:** I interviewed two friends who are passionate about baking and know their foods very well!
- **Obesity-related data:** There were tons of statistics available online!
- This project has less programming but more interesting data points that I creatively collected.
##Growth##
- I explored the powerful Datawrapper and learned to turn country codes into flags!
- Finding international angles and researching in multiple languages was what I enjoyed the most!
##Things I wish I could do##
- I thought about the carb aspect of the American diet -- but that's another story!
- More diverse comparisons: I also had OREO data of other countries, and I felt like if I had time I could've added a few more relatable comparisons to make this story more fun!
