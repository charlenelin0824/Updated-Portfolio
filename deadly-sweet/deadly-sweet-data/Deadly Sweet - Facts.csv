,The Standard American Diet: What is it and Where do we go Next?,American Diet,"we eat too much-saturated fat in the form of red meat and high-fat dairy products, too much fast food, and too many refined carbohydrates, added sugars, salt, and overall calories. "
,,Dietary Guidelines,"relying on fast food for most meals does increase calorie, salt, and sugar intakes substantially, while reducing vitamin and mineral intakes needed for good health. This is especially true for younger Americans."
,,Diet Quality Index - International (DQI-I),"The USDA Dietary Guidelines for Americans defines the standard American diet (SAD) as being too low in fresh fruits and vegetables, whole grains, lean protein, and healthy oils, and too high in red meat, high-fat dairy products, processed and fast foods, refined carbohydrates, added sugars, salt, and calories."
,,Iconic American Food,"Eating a Standard American DIet is a root cause of the “diseases of civilization.”
Diseases of civilization include heart disease, diabetes, cancer, infertility, mental health issues, and other metabolic diseases."
,,,"Refined carbohydrate consumption is the main culprit in the proliferation of these disease states, in large part because high blood sugar increases body inflammation, which triggers other disease processes. More on this later. "
,,,"Chronic inflammation is implicated in a wide variety of diseases including heart disease, metabolic syndrome, and diabetes, cancer, autoimmune conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis, infertility, and mental disorders such as depression"
,,,"blood sugar instability and fatty acid deficiencies can impair our brain chemistry. 
oxidative stress[33] can be a trigger for mental issues as well."
,,CK source,"In 2010 new recommendations from the American Heart Association were released that advised consumption of added sugars be only 5 percent of daily calories (Johnson et al., 2010). For adult women, this would be fewer than 100 calories (about 25 g or 6 teaspoons) per day, and for adult men, fewer than 150 calories (about 37.5 g or 9 teaspoons) per day. Based on NHANES 2003–2006 data, 13 percent of the American population had an added-sugars intake of more than 25 percent of calories (Marriott et al., 2010)."
,Standard American Diet,,"three out of four Americans don’t eat a single piece of fruit in a given day, and nearly nine out of ten don’t reach the minimum recommended daily intake of vegetables. "
,,,"On a weekly basis, 96 percent of Americans don’t reach the minimum for greens or beans (three servings a week for adults), 98 percent don’t reach the minimum for orange vegetables (two servings a week), and 99 percent don’t reach the minimum for whole grains (about three to four ounces a day). “In conclusion,” the researchers wrote, “nearly the entire U.S. population consumes a diet that is not on par with recommendations."
,,,"A dietary quality index was developed reflecting the percentage of calories people derive from nutrient-rich, unprocessed plant foods on a scale of 0 to 100. The standard American diet reportedly rates 11 out of 100. "

,Obesity-related cardiovascular disease deaths tripled between 1999 and 2020,Obesity,"Obesity remains a global public health crisis and is a major risk factor for cardiovascular disease. It currently affects about 42% of the U.S. population, an increase by almost 10% from the preceding decade, according to the American Heart Association’s 2023 statistics."
,,,"Overall, obesity-related cardiovascular disease deaths tripled from 2.2 per 100,000 population to 6.6 per 100,000 population between 1999 and 2020."
,,,"Researchers analyzed data collected from 1999 to 2020 on 281,135 deaths in which obesity was recorded as a contributing factor in The Multiple Cause of Death database includes mortality and population counts from all U.S. counties."
,,,"Among the deaths, 43.6% were in women; 78.1% of the group were white adults; 19.8% were Black adults; 1.1% were Asian or Pacific Islander adults and 1% were American Indian adults or Alaskan Native adults."
