## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r setup}

library(tidyverse)

#install.packages("janitor")
library(janitor)

#install.packages("tidycensus")
library(tidycensus)
```
```{r load}

centers <- read_csv("Input/2021_ART__Patient_and_Cycle_Characteristics_20240530.csv") %>%
    clean_names()
  
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

```

```{r join}
